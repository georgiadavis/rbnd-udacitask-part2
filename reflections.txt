# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I took a REALLY long break between this project and the last (2 months) so its taken quite a bit of time to get back into the context of the lessons. So far I've spent about a week or so working on this project.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
None yet so far. Still trying to get my bearings. I really like Ruby gems though.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
None yet so far!
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Inheriting legacy code and refactoring is REALLY hard. It feels like begin helicopter dropped into an ocean and needing to learn how to swim while sharks are attacking.
